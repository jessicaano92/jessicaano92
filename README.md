### Hello! I'm Jessica Anocibar.

## Friend, Student, and Mentor

My curiosity got the best of me. Wanting to understand web development and learn a new skillset, I started my coding journey all with a click of an ad! Having graduated from the Full Stack Web Development program from the University of Denver in December 2020, my hunger and eagerness for learning and understanding new programs and languages doesn't stop there. At the moment, I currently mentor and assist a class of 17 students as a volunteer teacher's assistant at Emily Griffith's Web Development pilot program.
