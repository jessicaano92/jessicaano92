### Hello! I'm Jessica Anocibar.

## Friend, Wife, Student, and Mentor

My curiosity got the best of me. Wanting to understand web development and learn a new skillset, I started my coding journey all with a click of an ad! Having graduated from a Full Stack Web Development program from the University of Denver in December 2020, my hunger for learning and understanding new programs and languages has been a great new advanture.
I currently mentor and assist a class of 17 students as a volunteer teacher's assistant at Emily Griffith's Web Development Pilot program!
