### Hello! I'm Jessica Anocibar.

## Friend, Wife, Student, and Mentor

I began my journey in coding all from a Facebook ad! They got me good. Having graduated from a Full Stack Web Development program from the University of Denver in December 2020, my hunger for learning and understanding new programs and languages has been a great new advanture.
I currently mentor and assist a class of 17 students as a volunteer teacher's assistant at Emily Griffith's Web Development Pilot program!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I usually spend more time in the air than on the ground. What does that mean? Let's chat and I'll tell you :)
